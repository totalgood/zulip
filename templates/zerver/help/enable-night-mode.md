# Enable night mode

Zulip's default visual theme has a white background, which works well
for most environments.  However, Zulip also provides a "night mode"
theme, which is great for working in a dark space.  You can switch to
night mode as follows:

{settings_tab|display-settings}

2. Select the option labeled **Night mode**.
